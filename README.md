# learn-me-fuel
Repository for various machine learning implementations for me research.

Given a very specific setup, run:
1. track_preds.py (for data that is only a large training set w/ 9779 instances)
2. old_track_preds.py (for data has a training set w/ 2313 instances and a separate testing set with ~90 instances)
3. cleanup and store results

Note: incompatible files being kept for future endeavors:
1. info_reduc.py
2. plotme.py
3. learnme.py
4. ipynb files
