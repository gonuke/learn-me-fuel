These results are all from the fissact subset bc there are no noticeable
differences in predictions so I'm just using the most "complete" set of the
filtered sets. 

Still running both training sets.

All results are from auto-optimized hyperparams. May want to refine this at a
later date to do a larger randomized search followed by a smaller grid search.
Because these are all auto-optimized I'm not running validation curves yet.
