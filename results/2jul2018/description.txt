This set of results is from the code revamp that I did in June 2018 for the
origen-data respository. These are tracking predictions for all nuclide subsets
with the same parameters.  Learning and prediction was carried out with both
training sets (labelled 1 and 2, after the Dayman-based and SFCOMPO-based sets,
respectively)

CV = 10 and kfold is shuffled; stratified kfold is used in 

k = 13 for kNN
alpha = 100 for Ridge
g = 0.001 and C = 10000 for SVR
top_n = 100

All nucs are scaled, no gammas are used so everything is scaled and normalized
with a 0 mean

Scores tracked are:  ['r2', 'explained_variance', 'neg_mean_absolute_error',
'neg_mean_squared_error'] for regression and accuracy only for classification
